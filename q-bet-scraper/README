3 Main scripts are:
odds_data_scraper.py
match_data_scraper.py
*** sync.py
scrape.py

scrape.py
This is the script you will use to handle scraping both match data and odds data by passing in a json or dictionary with links to what you want to scrape
The functions require you to pass in a directory to store outputted json
Please use:
./data/odds/ for odds data
./data/match/ for match data
./data/full/ for synced data


odds_data_scraper.py
This script will scrape the odds from oddsportal.com and generate a json file

match_data_scraper.py
This script will scrape the match data from bo3.gg and generate a json file

sync.py (WIP)
This script will take both match and odds data and "zip" the files together

1. Change odds_file to your odds_file in scrape.py
2. Change mtach_file to your match_file in scrape.py
*** odds_file = {yourname}_odds.json
*** match_file = {yourname}_match.json
