# League of Legends eSports Moneyline Betting Agent

**CS 486 Final Project — Drexel University**

This project implements a **reinforcement learning agent** that places **moneyline bets** on professional _League of Legends_ esports matches. The goal is to learn optimal betting strategies by balancing **profit maximization** with **risk management**.

## TODO: Update with actual project stuff

## Project Overview

We train a DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) agent that:

- Observes match state and betting odds in real time
- Decides **when** and **how** to place bets
- Learns to maximize **expected return** over time

Core components:

- Match state embeddings from LoL esports data
- A3C/DQN-based reinforcement learning model
- Custom reward function that simulates profit/loss from bets

## Objectives

- Apply RL algorithms to a real-world domain (sports betting)
- Analyze decision timing, expected value, and model confidence
