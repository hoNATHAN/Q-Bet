## ðŸŽ® Project Overview

We train a DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) agent that:

- Observes match state and betting odds in real time
- Decides **when** and **how** to place bets
- Learns to maximize **expected return** over time

Core components:

- Match state embeddings from LoL esports data
- A3C/DQN-based reinforcement learning model
- Custom reward function that simulates profit/loss from bets

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Apply RL algorithms to a real-world domain (sports betting)
- Analyze decision timing, expected value, and model confidence
