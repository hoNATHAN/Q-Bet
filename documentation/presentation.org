* PRESENTATION NOTES
** How to Evaluate States?
   - betting is novel in quantitative finance field
   - lots of games have various states, state explosion inbound
   - what if there was a game that heavily centered around econ performance?
     * Counter Strike 2 is our answer

** Our novel idea to experiment
   - what if we treat a team in Counter Strike 2 as a market asset?
   - ML is popular for trading
   - stock prices and assets are known to be tracked and computed to give advantage for trading
     * why not do the same for sports betting ?

** Signal to Noise ratio
   - our main goal was to experiment and see if sophisticated market signals improve agent performance
   - raw game states can be inherrently noisy
     * if i told you to make a prediction with just money, money spent, and who won...
     * that would be hard
   - utilized a few market signals
     * delta econ - market swings
     * ROI of team
     * CPK - are teams actually using money efficient
   - lets compare performances 

** Agent specific experiments
   - basic reward (binary, if agent guesses correct)
   - complex reward (actual return on investments based on odds)
   - basic action (just pick or abstain)
   - complex action (bigger discrete space, add % to the mix)
  
** Our findings
** Code walkthrough
