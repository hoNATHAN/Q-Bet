Description:
    Scans a directory of match JSON files and builds a lookup table mapping
    each match_id to a dictionary of game_name â†’ last_round_winner. Writes the
    resulting lookup JSON to a specified output path.

def build_match_winner_lookup(folder_path):
    """
    Scans all .json files under the given folder_path and constructs a lookup
    dictionary in the form:
        {
            match_id: {
                game_name: last_round_winner,
                ...
            },
            ...
        }

    For each JSON file:
      - Attempts to load it.
      - Uses 'match_id' from the file content (or filename if missing).
      - Iterates through each 'game' in data["games"], sorts its rounds by
        numeric suffix, and records the 'winner' from the last round.

    Parameters:
        folder_path (str): Path to the directory containing match JSON files.

    Returns:
        dict: A mapping from each match_id to its per-game last-round winner data.
